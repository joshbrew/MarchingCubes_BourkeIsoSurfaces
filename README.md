# MarchingCubes_BourkeIsoSurfaces
WGSL compute shader and CPU implementations side by side for Classic Bourke Marching Cubes algorithm in a single HTML file.  

WIP turning this into proper tooling with a reusable shader pipeline for speed to generate isosurfaces from arbitrary point cloud data.

I am also working on a Marching Cubes 33 Implementation in plain JS but it's much more difficult.
